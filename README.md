# Lucas & Gustavs Frontend 3

# Home
We have built an application using React that lists people, dogs, cats and other. The information about the users shown att the Home route is name, age, email and type (human, dog, cat, other). On this page it is possible to filter information. We have created a search function where you can search for names, email or type. The search bar is shown above the table with the user information. Underneath the table a function calculating the sum of all the users age is shown.  
To view a specific user you can press a name in the table to see all the information available about that user. 

# Add user

On the route Add user we have created a form to input user information. When you press the "Submit" button the provided information is sent to a JSON server and saved together with all the already existing user information. After you have pressed the "Submit" button you are directed back to the Home route where you can se the table with the newly added information.

# Styling
To style the application we have used SASS as we think it is a easy and good way to style applications. We have created several SCSS files to style the different components. For general styling of for example the style of the font and the background color we also have a general SCSS file that affects all parts of the application.
